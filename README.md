# processingLanguage-Simulations-

A simple pendulum simulation using Processing 
Given a pendulum with an angle theta (0 being the pendulum at rest) and a radius r
we can use sine to calculate the angular component of the gravitational force.

Gravity Force = Mass * Gravitational Constant;
Pendulum Force = Gravity Force * sine(theta)
Angular Acceleration = Pendulum Force / Mass = gravitational acceleration * sine(theta);

there is a specific angle beetween the pendulums where they change their colors  which is  p/7 where they somehow converged to touch each other
